# About
-HelpMeHelpYou is designed to counter the paradoxical effect technology has on society. While most applications seek to digitize human connection, this project looks to connect users through mutual need and create actual human interaction. Using the google Maps API, this app determines precise coordinates relating to the registered user's address and using this data to find people looking for/ offering help in the user's immediate area.
